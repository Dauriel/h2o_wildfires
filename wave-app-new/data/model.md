## Technical Documentation

Our approach consists on a lightweight YoloV5s model trained to detect smoke. This model is trained over the [Wildfire Smoke Detection Dataset](https://github.com/aiformankind/wildfire-smoke-detection-research) created by [AI for Mankind](https://aiformankind.org/).

The solution is in the form of a jupyter notebook that contains detailed descriptions of each step. We developed the code on a Google Colab instance, so just by uploading it and running it fully you should obtain equivalent results to ours.
